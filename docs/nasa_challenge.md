# NASA Space App Challenge: Data Pathways to Healthy Cities and Human Settlements

### Summary
Climate change brings about new complexities to consider for maintaining the wellbeing of society and the environment in cities. Natural resources, ecosystems, and existing infrastructure all must be monitored to ensure human quality of life remains high. Your challenge is to demonstrate how an urban planner can use NASA Earth observation data to develop smart strategies for city growth that maintain both the wellbeing of people and the environment.

### Background
With over half of the global population living in cities, it is crucial to ensure that quality of life in these urban areas is high while local natural landscapes remain intact. Depending on the location, climate change makes certain areas more vulnerable to extreme weather incidences and other hazards that can impact human health and economic growth. Drastic environmental changes due to flooding, drought, and extreme temperatures also cause vulnerabilities for local ecosystems and natural resources. Areas with decreased vegetation and soil exposure due to high urbanization can be especially affected by these factors. Industrial pollution is also a stressor for human communities and wildlife.

Despite these complexities, transportation systems, healthcare facilities, local greenspace, and housing access must be well managed to keep cities functioning. Urban planners are responsible for shaping how local infrastructure should best support communities within their landscapes. Fast-growing cities must implement balanced designs to enable both successful economic development and climate resilience. Earth observation data resources can inform urban planning strategies. Data on air quality, water quality, and land use can help planners assess the sustainability of urban environments over time, and support better decision-making for long-term growth.


### Objectives
Your challenge is to develop a project plan informed by NASA Earth science data that not only improves quality of life for residents of a fast-growing city, but takes environmental considerations into account. This challenge provides an opportunity to demonstrate the importance of Earth science data to people- and planet-conscious urban planning!

Think about how each topic you address in your plan could be supported by Earth observation data showing possible impacts upon natural resources, ecosystems, and existing infrastructure. In your plan, donâ€™t forget to explain how city leaders would be involved in your proposed concept. For example, if you are describing a problem with access to greenspace, you could explain how the local parks department should be involved in finding solutions informed by the data you suggest. You can also describe how residents could contribute information to inform your plan about specific challenges in their neighborhoods.

How can you present your project most effectively? Will you develop an online tool or website, a video presentation, or something else?


### Potential Considerations
You may (but are not required to) consider the following:

Below are some questions you could consider as you develop your project; we recommend selecting no more than three to address:

- How would an urban planner determine which communities need better access to food, housing, or transportation?
- Which areas are dealing with polluted air or water, and how can that be addressed?
- Where do new healthcare facilities need to be set up?
- Which communities need better access to local parks?
- Which parts of the city are experiencing the most growth, and where is new housing development most needed?
- What public health resources or safety measures could be provided for areas dealing with extreme heat or dangerous winter conditions?
- How are local freshwater, coastal, or forest habitats being affected by industrial growth?
- Where should more land be utilized for agricultural activity to feed a growing population?
- How can waste management be improved?
- Are there communities where access to electricity and other energy sources is scarce? How might this situation be addressed?
